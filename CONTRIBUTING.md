## Writing commit messages
Based on [**Chris Beams**](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) seven Rules of a great Git commit message.

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
1. Capitalize the subject line.
1. Do not end the subject line with a period.
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
1. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

**Example Title:**
```
Add styling navigation bar
```

* [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) is used for commit messages
* [Linter-xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) is used to lint the JavaScript.
